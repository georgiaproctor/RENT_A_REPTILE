As a team of 5 students, we designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB - with reptiles being listed and rented instead of apartments!

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
